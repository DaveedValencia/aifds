# AIFDS Roadmap

This roadmap tracks upcoming work across schema profiles, conformance rules, and documentation.

## Near Term

- **Collections Profile (Ecommerce)** – JSON-LD schema covering category/listing pages with canonical navigation, pagination, and product evidence.
- **Product Detail Profile (Ecommerce)** – Schema for product JSON-LD including offers, availability evidence, and freshness signals.
- **Validation Samples** – Expanded example payloads demonstrating Bad/Average/Good/Excellent scoring outcomes for the homepage profile.

## Mid Term

- **Service Business Profile** – Draft schema for service providers with serviceArea, offer catalog, and credential evidence.
- **Navigation JSON** – Canonical navigation export referenced by multiple profiles (see spec §5.5).
- **Newsletter CTA** – Add opt-in module on the site with structured data for subscription endpoints.

## Long Term

- **Automated Conformance Reports** – Publish machine-readable reports summarizing rule coverage per deployment.
- **Schema Registry** – Host versioned schema endpoints with change history and migration notes.
- **Third-Party Evidence Integrations** – Guidance and tooling for linking external proof (certifications, reviews, filings).
